//! Inter-hart IPI mailbox.

//! A CLINT software interrupt is a single bit, but it can mean several things:
//! relay a supervisor IPI (SSIP), run a remote FENCE.I, or a remote SFENCE.VMA.
//! Each hart has a pending-operation bitmask. A sender ORs in the ops it wants,
//! signals the target's MSIP, and, for fences, waits for the target to clear the
//! bits. This gives synchronous RFENCE semantics.
